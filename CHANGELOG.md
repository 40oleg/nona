# Changelog

## v0.3.0 — 2026-09-26

- Added standalone Linux x64 ELF output with direct syscalls, native compatibility examples, and a Linux CI job.
- Extended the supported language subset with default and destructuring parameters, array/object/call spread, classes and inheritance, generators and `yield*`, and tagged templates.
- Added selected Math, String, Array, and global numeric built-ins; expanded Symbol, iterator, and object behavior.
- Extended precise GC to suspended generator stacks and new runtime objects, with native stress tests.
- Expanded Windows regression and pinned Test262 smoke coverage. See [v0.3 status](docs/v0.3-status.md) for measured results and remaining gaps.

This is an experimental subset release. It does not complete ES2020; `eval` and dynamic Function constructors remain documented exceptions.

## v0.2.0 — 2026-09-26

- Added arrows, rest parameters, untagged templates, Symbols, `for...in`, `for...of`, iterators, and selected built-ins for the Windows x64 target.
- Established the [ES2020 completion contract](docs/es2020-contract.md) and a pinned Test262 smoke baseline. See [v0.2 status](docs/v0.2-status.md).

## v0.1 — 2026-09-24

Initial public development release.

- Compiles the documented JavaScript subset to standalone Windows x64 PE executables.
- Emits x86-64 machine code directly and includes a small native runtime and precise mark-and-sweep garbage collector.
- Supports functions, closures, objects, arrays, descriptors, strict mode, exceptions, exponentiation, nullish coalescing, and optional chaining within the documented limits.
- Includes a command-line compiler, examples, compatibility programs, and native execution tests.

This release is experimental and does not implement complete ECMAScript or Node.js compatibility. See the [language support matrix](docs/language-support.md) for exact coverage.
